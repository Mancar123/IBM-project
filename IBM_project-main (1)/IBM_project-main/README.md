# IBM Project

## Overview
The IBM Project focuses on Anomaly Detection in Ambient Temperature Data. The objective is to identify anomalies using machine learning techniques and deploy the model on IBM Cloud for real-time monitoring.

## Features
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring
- API-based model deployment using IBM Watson Studio
- Secure authentication and access control
- Automated alerts via email and SMS

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask for API development
- Machine Learning: Isolation Forest, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, D3.js, Plotly
- IBM Cloud Services for model hosting
- Docker & Kubernetes for scalability

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ABHISHEKHUBBALLI08/IBM_project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd IBM_project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask API:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Deployment
### Deploying on IBM Cloud
1. Sign up for an IBM Cloud account.
2. Upload the trained model to IBM Watson Studio.
3. Deploy the model as a REST API.
4. Generate an API key for authentication.

## Usage
1. Upload temperature datasets via the dashboard.
2. Detect anomalies using the deployed model.
3. View interactive visualizations of detected anomalies.
4. Receive real-time alerts for anomalies.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Open a pull request.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time streaming with Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
- AI-driven adaptive learning for continuous improvement.
- Blockchain-based logging for secure anomaly tracking.
- Edge computing for IoT-based anomaly detection.
